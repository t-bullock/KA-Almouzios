# KA Almouzios

KA Almouzios (almost Chourmouzios) is a typeface that almost looks like the popular Chourmouzios font, used in the Palaion Didaskalon Koinonika books.

This font is designed for typing Byzantine Music Scores using the program [Kassia](https://github.com/t-bullock/Kassia), but can be used in any word processor or text editor.
